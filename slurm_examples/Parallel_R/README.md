Focusing on R, one may think on two general types of parallelising scripts. First, 'internal' parallelisation within your script can be accomplished using `foreach` and `doParallel` packages, or alternatively via functions that incorporate internal parallelisation schemes such as `brm` from package `brms`. Second, external parallelisation can be done via setting up a slurm job array.
